### To play:
Run game.py with all five .py files (board.py, chess_utilities.py, game.py, gui.py, and pieces.py) and the assets folder in the same directory. If all files are in the current working directory, run
```
$ python game.py
```

### Dependencies:
All dependencies (tkinter) are probably already included in your Python installation.
